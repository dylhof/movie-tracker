# Movie Tracker

https://github.com/dylhof/movie-tracker-ui

Movie Tracker allows movie buffs to browse the most popular movies out now and sign in to track their favories.  They can click on any of the movies to see additional details for that movie and can see all of their tracked favorites in one place. This app was built using React, Redux and Router.

## Set-up
Create a new directory to hold both your frontend and backend directories

Go to `https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker` and follow instructions including cloning the repo into the newly created directory

Clone down the frontend repo into the directory: 
` git clone https://github.com/dylhof/movie-tracker-ui.git`

Start the backend locally (localhost:3000)

` npm start `

In a new terminal, install the frontend and start on a new local server (localhost:3001)

` npm install ` and ` npm start`

To run tests: 

` npm test `
