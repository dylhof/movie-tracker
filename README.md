# Movie Tracker

https://github.com/dylhof/movie-tracker-ui

Movie Tracker allows movie buffs to browse the most popular movies out now and sign in to track their favories.  They can click on any of the movies to see additional details for that movie and can see all of their tracked favorites in one place. This app was built using React, Redux and Router.
